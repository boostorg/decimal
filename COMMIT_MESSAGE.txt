Optimize sqrt() using lookup table to reduce Newton iterations

Replace Padé approximation with 32-entry lookup table approach,
reducing Newton-Raphson iterations from 3-5 to 1-3 based on precision.

- Add sqrt lookup tables for [0.1, 1.0) range with interpolation
- Reduce iterations: decimal32 (1), decimal64 (2), decimal128 (3)
- Maintain existing normalization and exponent handling

Performance: Fewer divisions per sqrt call with faster convergence.

Known issues: Some precision gaps remain, particularly for decimal32.
Further optimization needed for interpolation and edge cases.
