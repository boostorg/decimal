Below are a few additional examples as to how the Decimal library can be used in the context of financial applications.
All of these examples can be found in the library `examples/` folder as well.

== Parsing Pricing Data from File
[#examples_money_parsing]
.This https://github.com/cppalliance/decimal/blob/develop/examples/numerical_parsing.cpp[example] demonstrates the numerical differences between parsing of monetary values between using `decimal32_t` and `float`

.Expected Output
....
Number of data points: 252
    Sum from MS Excel: 52151.99
Sum using decimal32_t: 52151.99
      Sum using float: 52151.96

.Expected Output
....
  Mean Closing Price: $207.20
Median Closing Price: $214.26
  Standard Deviation: $25.45
