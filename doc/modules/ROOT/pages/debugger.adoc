Currently, Boost.Decimal supports pretty printing with LLDB.
To load the pretty printer, add the following line to your `.lldbinit`:

[source]
----
command script import /path/to/decimal/extra/decimal_printer.py
----

Once you have loaded `decimal_printer.py` you can run the following example to see how different values are represented with the pretty printer.

.The following example can be run with the debugger to show a variety of values
====

[source,c++]
----
include::example$debugger.cpp[]
----

*_Expected Output for T = decimal32_t:_*

image::dec32_debug.png[]

*_Expected Output for T = decimal_fast32_t:_*

image::dec32_fast_debug.png[]
====

The reason for the difference in how `decimal32_t` and `decimal_fast32_t` is displayed is due to xref:cohorts.adoc[Cohorts and Normalization]

. `decimal32_t`, `decimal64_t` and `decimal128_t` debuggers are cohort preserving
. `decimal_fast32_t`, `decimal_fast64_t` and `decimal_fast128_t` debuggers are always normalized
