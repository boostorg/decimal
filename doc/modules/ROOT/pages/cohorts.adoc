[#cohorts]
= Cohorts
:idprefix: cohorts_

As stated in the library overview, one of the major differences between binary floating point and decimal floating point is the existence of cohorts.
From IEEE 754-2008: "The set of representations a floating-point number maps to is called the floating-point
number’s cohort; the members of a cohort are distinct representations of the same floating-point number."

For example `decimal32_t` has a precision of 7.
That means all the following are valid ways to represent the number 300 using that type:

. 3e+2
. 30e+1
. 300e+0
. 3000e-1
. 30000e-2
. 300000e-3
. 3000000e-4

These values can be useful in certain applications, like preserving the precision of results.
By default, most methods *DO NOT* observe cohorts.
Below is an example of how cohorts can be preserved if one so wishes.
